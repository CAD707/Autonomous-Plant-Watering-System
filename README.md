# Autonomous-Plant-Watering-System

In this project, the soil watering process is programmed to occur in an event wherein the soil bearing the plant is nearly completely void of moisture. Correspondingly, my methodology toward undertaking the challenge of automated plant watering involved 8 crucial components. These components functioned interconnectedly to bring about the complete functionality of the system and comprised of A capacitive soil moisture sensing module, 2 DC water pump modules, 1 with an interconnected potentiometer module, an 8 (four Reds and four Greens) LED display module connected with a shift register, a water sensing module, a PIR sensing module with a corresponding LED notification system, a temperature sensing module and an LCD display module. The resultant functionality created the automatic plant watering system and is described as follows. On sensing an abnormal soil moisture level, the device will cause the water to be pumped from a buffer tank via the first DC motor, followed by the tankâ€™s replenishing, upon the water contained in it, going below a specific low point. Moreover, the temperature being constantly sensed is displayed along with the watering status and soil moisture levels, along with the presence of an obstacle, blocking the source of natural light. An option to manually override the watering system is also provided to the operator via a push button.
