# Autonomous-Plant-Watering-System

In this project, the soil watering process is programmed to occur in an event wherein the soil bearing the plant is nearly completely void of moisture. Correspondingly, my methodology toward undertaking the challenge of automated plant watering involved 8 crucial components. These components functioned interconnectedly to bring about the complete functionality of the system and comprised of A capacitive soil moisture sensing module, 2 DC water pump modules, 1 with an interconnected potentiometer module, an 8 (four Reds and four Greens) LED display module connected with a shift register, a water sensing module, a PIR sensing module with a corresponding LED notification system, a temperature sensing module and an LCD display module. The resultant functionality created the automatic plant watering system and is described as follows. On sensing an abnormal soil moisture level, the device will cause the water to be pumped from a buffer tank via the first DC motor, followed by the tankâ€™s replenishing, upon the water contained in it, going below a specific low point. Moreover, the temperature being constantly sensed is displayed along with the watering status and soil moisture levels, along with the presence of an obstacle, blocking the source of natural light. An option to manually override the watering system is also provided to the operator via a push button.

# Build Instructions

## Block Diagram - Inputs & Outputs

Following is a block diagram indicative of the various modules integrated into the circuitry and the manner in which the flow of information takes place. With the help of this the operator can comprehend the connection of the components.

## Circuit View

In order to further understand the circuit assembly, here's a circuit view sketched in TinkerCAD, that details the connections of all the vital components in a neat and comprehensive manner. Following this circuit design, one could build the same circuitry, and even enhance the same, for better results. Note, the basic circuitry must be built in accordance with the design as shown below. Upon successfully building and coding the basic design, the designer may then feel free to modify the circuit as per their preferences. 

Now, the entire circuitry is assembled on a breadboard with the use of jumper wires to establish the various connections as seen in the diagrams below. using a breadboard is always advisable, especially if the components you are working with are volatile, or in the event that you might want to develop yet another prototype before deploying the final circuit build.
